# **📦 Management Stock**

## **📝 Description**

Management Stock is an application developed using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for inventory management. It allows administrators to update, register, and delete inventory items. A future implementation includes converting the value of the Brazilian Real into different currencies, such as USD, to provide a comprehensive view of product availability and make it mobile too.

## **🎯 Features**

- **Inventory Update**: Administrators can update information about existing products in the inventory.

- **Item Registration**: Administrators can add new products to the inventory by providing details such as name, category, quantity, and price.

- **Item Deletion**: Administrators have the ability to remove products from the inventory when needed.

- **Currency Conversion**: A planned feature will enable the conversion of the Brazilian Real value into USD and possibly other currencies, facilitating a better understanding of product pricing in different currency denominations.
